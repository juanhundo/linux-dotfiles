# Linux Dotfiles (Laptop Branch)
These are the dotfiles that I run on my Arch Linux machines. My workflow is largely centered around minimal mouse usage and comfortable ergonomics by using a tiling window manager, Colemak layout, and a [40% keyboard](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1851/5125/products/21827010_498892353823145_230429595340374016_n_1024x1024@2x.jpg?v=1535054340). In addition, this repository also has the configs I post in the [Linux ricing community](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). My up-to-date configs have transitioned from using i3wm and lemonbar to bspwm and Polybar, but I still keep most of my old configs in the repository.
